\SSpsetQ{

    Circles $\omega_1$ of radius 20 and $\omega_2$ of radius 21 are externally tangent at $P$. 
    Points $A$ and $B$, both distinct from $P$, lie on $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, respectively, 
    such that $AB = 42$ and $A, P, B$ are collinear. Find $\lfloor 100 PA \rfloor$. \calculator
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    Connect the center of $\omega_1$ to $A$ and $P$ and the center of $\omega_2$ to $B$ and $P$. 
    Then, we have two isosceles triangles with equal base angles (the angles at $P$ are vertical angles) 
    so $$\dfrac{AP}{BP} = \dfrac{r_1}{r_2} = \dfrac{20}{21} \iff AP = 42 \cdot \dfrac{20}{41} \iff \boxed{2048}.$$
\end{solution}\bigskip
