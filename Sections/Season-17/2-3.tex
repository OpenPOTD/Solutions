\SSpsetQ{
  Find the sum of all real solutions to $$\sum_{k = -30}^{14} \dfrac{4x}{(x + k)(x + k + 1)} = 9.$$
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
  We proceed with partial fraction decomposition. Note that 
  $$\dfrac{1}{x + k} - \dfrac{1}{x + k + 1} = \dfrac{1}{(x + k)(x + k + 1)}$$
  so our sum is $$4x\left(\dfrac{1}{x - 30} - \dfrac{1}{x + 15}\right) = 9 = \dfrac{4x \cdot 45}{(x - 30)(x + 15)}$$
  and the quadratic boils down to $$(x - 30)(x + 15) = 20x \iff x^2 - 35x - 450 = 0 = (x - 45)(x + 10)$$ 
  but $x = -10$ makes the denominator of $\frac{4x}{(x + 10)(x + 11)}$ zero and so is not a valid solution. 
  Our answer is \fbox{45}.
