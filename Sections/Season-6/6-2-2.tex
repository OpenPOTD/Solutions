\SSpsetQ{
\(N\) is the smallest positive integer such that the sum of the digits of \(N\) is 18 and the sum of the digits of \(2N\) is 27. Find \(N\). 
	%Put Problem Here
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

We iterate through cases of $2N$. \smallskip

The only 3 digit number with a digit sum of $27$ is $999$ but $2N = 999$ does not work since 999 is not even. \smallskip

$2N = 1998$ is the next smallest even number with digit sum 27 and $N = 999$ does not work. \smallskip

$2N = 2898$ is the next smallest even number with digit sum 27 and it does work, giving $N = \boxed{1449}$.
