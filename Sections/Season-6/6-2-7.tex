\SSpsetQ{
Suppose a point \(P\) is a random point chosen inside a triangle \(XYZ\). Extend the segment \(XP\) until it intersects with the circumcircle of \(PYZ\), call the point of intersection which isn't \(P\), \(X_1\). Similarly, for points \(Y\) and \(Z\) construct points \(Y_1\) and \(Z_1\). What is the smallest value of

\begin{equation*}
  \left(1+2\frac{XP}{PX_1}\right)\left(1+2\frac{YP}{PY_1}\right)\left(1+2\frac{ZP}{PZ_1}\right)
\end{equation*}
