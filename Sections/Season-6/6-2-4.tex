\SSpsetQ{
   Let $ABCDEZYXWV$ be an equilateral decagon with interior angles $\angle A = \angle V = \angle E = \angle Z = \angle C = 90 ^\circ$, 
   $\angle W = \angle Y = 135 ^\circ$, 
   $\angle B = \angle D = 225 ^\circ$, and 
   $\angle X = 270 ^\circ$.
  Find the sum of all $1 < n<100$ such that $ABCDEZYXWV$ can be partition into $n$ congruent polygons. 
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    Cut along horizontally such that the vertical distance for each line is constant. This shows that all $n$ is possible. 
    Thus, the answer is $\frac{99\cdot 100}{2}-1 = 4949$.
\end{solution}\bigskip
