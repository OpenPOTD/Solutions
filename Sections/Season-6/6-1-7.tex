\SSpsetQ{
  Brainy, being the socialite he is, has invited a large number of friends to a little soir\'ee. Brainy will be feeding his friends Chinese Noodle Soup, made by Tony himself.\\

  Wanting to impress Asuka, and Zero-Two, both of whom will be at the party, he asks Tony to provide the party with many different flavours of soup - enough so that for each flavour, there are \(260\) bowls of soup.\\

  When Brainy's friends arrive at the party, each of them take exatly two soups, each of different flavours.
  
  Given that for any \(179\) of Brainy's friends, there will at least be two who have at least one flavour of Chinese Noodle Soup in common, and assuming Brainy has invited as many people as possible to the party, how many people are in attendance?
