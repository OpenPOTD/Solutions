\SSpsetQ{
Find the sum of all integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) such that 

\begin{equation*}
    x^2+y^2+z^2=2(yz+1)\ \mathrm{and}\ x+y+z=4018
\end{equation*}
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

We can write the first equation as \(x^2+(y-z)^2=2\), and so since \(x^2\) and \((y-z)^2\) are both greater than or equal to 0, we must have the following cases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(x^2=0\) and \((y-z)^2=2\)
    \item \(x^2=2\) and \((y-z)^2=0\)
    \item \(x^2=1\) and \((y-z)^2=1\)
\end{enumerate}

Clearly in cases one and two, we cannot have integer solutions, thus we consider the two possible subcases of the third: when \(x=\pm 1\). \\ \\

When \(x=\pm1\), we have either \(y=1+z\) or \(y=z-1\). Substituting these values into \(x+y+z=4018\) gives us the set of \(x\)'s \(y\)'s, and \(z\)'s as \(\{-1,1,2008,2009,2010\}\)

Hence our final answer is \(-1+1+2008+2009+2010=\fbox{6027}\).
