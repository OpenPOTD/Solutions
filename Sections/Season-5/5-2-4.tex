\SSpsetQ{
Let $k$ be a positive real number. In the Cartesian coordinate plane, let $S$ be the set of all points of the form $(x,x^2+k)$ where $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Let $C$ be the set of all circles whose center lies in $S$, and which are tangent to $X$-axis. Find the minimum value of $k$ such that any two circles in $C$ have at least one point of intersection. \\
If $k = \frac mn$ where $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ and $m, n$ are positive integers, find \(m + n\).
