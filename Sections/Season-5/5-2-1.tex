\SSpsetQ{
    Two pentagons are attached to form a new polygon $P$. What is the minimum number of sides $P$ can have? \\

    \begin{center}
      \emph{Note: The two pentagons are not necessarily regular. }
    \end{center}
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

  The answer is $\boxed{3}$ as shown in the following diagram. Anything less will result in a shape that is not a polygon.
 
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    // let the vertices be (-3,0)(3,0), and (0, 5)
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (-3.0,-0)--(0,5.0);
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (0,5.0)--(-0.5, 3.3);
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (-0.5, 3.3)--(0.5, 1.6);
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (0.5,1.6)--(0.0,0.0);
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (0.0,0.0)--(3.0,0.0);
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (3,0,0.0)--(0.0,5.0);
    \draw[line width = 0.4pt] (-3,0)--(0,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
