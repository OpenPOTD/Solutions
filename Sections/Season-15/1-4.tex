\SSpsetQ{
Distinct prime numbers $p, q, r$ satisfy the equation 
\[
2pqr + 50 pq = 7pqr + 55pr = 8pqr + 12qr = A
\]
for some positive integer $A$. What is $A$?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
Comparing the first two equations, we get 
\begin{align*}
    50pq - 55pr &= 5pqr \iff \\
    10q - 11r &= qr \iff \\
    (q+11)(r-10) &= -110 
\end{align*}
Since $q,r$ are positive integers, $(r-10)$ must be negative and $(11+q)$ must be a divisor of $110$ larger than $11$. A quick check gives that $q$ must be $11$, which gives that $r = 5$. Plugging these values into the original equation gives $p = 3$ and thus $A = \boxed{1980}$.
