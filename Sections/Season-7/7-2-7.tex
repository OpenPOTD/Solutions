\SSpsetQ{
    Having successfully gathered the PSC and escaped the scheming MODSbot, Brainy manages to lead the group to the jungle. Not far into the jungle, they meet Tan, who tells them that he is their mysterious advisor. He also says that he needs to take them to the last remaining population of wild triangles. \medskip

Some of the triangles are a deep shade of red; Tan explains that a triangle $\triangle ABC$ is red if given its incenter $I$, points $B_1$ and $C_1$ the intersections of $BI$ and $CI$ with $AC$ and $AB$ and $P$, $Q$ the intersections of line $PQ$ with $(ABC)$, $\angle PIQ$ attains the minimal possible value over all acute triangles. Each red triangle has upon its face the value of $\cos(\angle BAC)$. \medskip

If the product of all numbers written on any triangle in the population for which $AB=AC$ can be written in the form $a - b\sqrt{c}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers with $c$ squarefree, find $10000a+100b+c$.
