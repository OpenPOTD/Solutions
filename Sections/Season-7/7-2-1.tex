\SSpsetQ{
What is the smallest two-digit positive integer with the properties that when divided by two,  it is equal to the product of its digits.
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

  Let the integer have digits \(x\) and \(y\). We require:
  \begin{align*}
    xy=&\frac{10x+y}{2}\\
    2xy-10x-y&=0\\
    2xy-10x-y+5&=5\\
    (2x-1)(y-5)&=5
  \end{align*}
Since 5 is prime, it has factors of either 1 or 5. Hence we have either \(y-5=5\) or \(y-5=1\). We don't need to consider negatives as it's clear \(x\) would not be positive (and non-zero). We see that \(y=6\), as in the other case, \(y>9\). THis means that \(2x-1=5\), giving \(x=3\). So the answer is \(\fbox{36}\)
\end{solution}\bigskip
