\SSpsetQ{
After Brainy discovered a map hidden within the regular polygon, he is able to navigate the PSC through the Jungle. It takes Brainy and the team 4 hours to navigate out of the jungle, moving 2 kilometres per hour walking up inclined surfaces, 6 kilometres an hour when walking down, and 3 kilometres an hour on flat surfaces.\\

Upon reaching the edge of the jungle Brainy realises that they accidentally left .19 back where they started. Given that it took Brainy and the PSC 6 hours to return to where they started, to rescue .19, what is the total distance Brainy travelled (in kilometres)?

\begin{solution}[Solution by \Pnjoy]\hfil\medskip
  
Let the two ``other'' points be $C$ and $D$, going from left to right (so that the labels when reading from left to right are $A,C,D,B$). We let $AC=x, CD=y, DB=z$. We have $\frac{x}{2}+\frac{y}{3}+\frac{z}{6}=4$ and $\frac{x}{6}+\frac{y}{3}+\frac{z}{2}=6$. Multiplying both equations by $6$ gives $3x+2y+z=24$ and $x+2y+3z=36$. Adding them gives $4x+4y+4z=60$, so our desired value, is $\fbox{30}$.
\end{solution}\bigskip

\begin{solution}[Solution by \Pbrain]\hfill\medskip
	
Note that the harmonic mean of $2$ and $6$ kph is $3$kph - in particular, since in total there's the same amount of uphill and downhill, we get that the average speed is $3$ kph and thus the PSC travelled $\boxed{30}$km.
