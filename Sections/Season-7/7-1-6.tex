\SSpsetQ{

    After the TST the PSC meets Chrispi. \medskip

    Chrispi has $255$ sheets of paper, each labeled with a unique nonempty subset of ${1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}$. Each minute, he chooses one sheet of paper uniformly at random out of the sheets of paper not yet eaten. \medskip
    
    Then, he eats that sheet of paper, and all remaining sheets of paper that are labeled with a subset of that sheet of paper (for example, if he chooses the sheet of paper labeled with ${1,2}$, he eats that sheet of paper as well as the sheets of paper with ${1}$ and ${2}$). \medskip
    
    The expected value of the number of minutes that Chrispi eats a sheet of paper before all sheets of paper are gone can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $100m + n$.
