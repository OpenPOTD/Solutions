\SSpsetQ{
  The Problem Selection Committee ventures into a jungle where they find a regular polygon drawn on the ground. Brainysmurfs takes out his infinite precision protractor and measures one of the interior angles to be 179 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
  The formula for the sum of the interior angles is given by \(180(n-2)\), and thus we have \(180(n-2)=179n\iff n=\fbox{360} \)
\end{solution}\bigskip
