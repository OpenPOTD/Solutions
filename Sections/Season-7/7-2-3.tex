\SSpsetQ{
  Returning home from Matteddy's demonstration, the PSC are trapped in a vault by NJOY, trying to join the PSC by coercion and brute force. On the wall are two haikus.
  The first reads:
  \begin{center}
  $\mathfrak{The\; sum\; of\; the\; squares}$\\
  $\mathfrak{of}\; a\; \mathfrak{and}\; b\; \mathfrak{minus\; their}$\\
  $\mathfrak{product\; fears}\; 15$\\
  \end{center}
  They take this to mean that the given expression of $a$ and $b$ is at most 15, before reading the second haiku:
  \begin{center}
  $\mathfrak{The\; unfearing\; sum}$\\
  $\mathfrak{of\; their\; fourth\; powers\; is\; on}$\\
  $\mathfrak{the\; door\; of\; freedom}$
  \end{center}
  which they take to mean that the door labeled with the maximal value of $a^4 + b^4$ is their exit.
  
  \medskip
  
  After some thought, they scan the walls for they want, climb up to it and walk out, to the rising moon. They've escaped.
  
  \medskip
  
  What door did they leave through?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

Notice that \(a^4+b^4=(a^2+b^2)^2-2(ab)^2\). Thus, \(a^4+b^4\leq (2+ab)^2-2(ab)^2\) - this is simply a quadratic in \(ab\).\\

Therefore, we have, by \emph{the method of maximising a quadratic of your choosing}

\begin{equation*}
  a^4+b^4\leq 450-(ab-2)^2
\end{equation*}
So our answer is \fbox{450}.
\end{solution}
