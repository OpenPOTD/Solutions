\SSpsetQ{
    Tony and Wang play a game. A triple $(p, s, c)$ of nonnegative integers which sum to $42069$ is written on the board. Both of them \textit{move}, with 
    Tony going first. \medskip

    The player who moves chooses a positive integer $n$ and selects one of the three integers on the board. The player then adds $n$ to that integer and subtracts 
    $n$ from each of the other two. A player loses if, right after they move, at least one of the integers on the board becomes negative. \medskip

    Find the number of triples $(p, s, c)$ for which Wang has a winning strategy.
