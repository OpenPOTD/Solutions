\SSpsetQ{
	Consider 2021 people with ages 20, 40, 60, $\cdots$, 40420. Each person's father (except 
	the 40420-year-old) is the person in the group who is 20 years older than them. \medskip

	Let $N$ be the number of ways to arrange any 2021 people in a queue such that no person 
	is somewhere behind someone who is their son. Find $N$.

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
	The troll here is realizing that girls exist. If all 2021 people are male, then there is 
	exactly one way to arrange them all, that is, in reversed age order. However, the 
	20-year-old need not be male; in this case they can go anywhere in the line for a total 
	of 2021 placements. Our answer is \fbox{2022}.
