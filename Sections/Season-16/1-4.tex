\SSpsetQ{
    A real number $a$ is selected uniformly at random between $-50$ and $50$ inclusive. 
    The probability that $20x - \left|21x - \left|x + \frac{20a}{21}\right|\right| = 42|x - 1|$ has real solutions
    can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. 
    Find $100m + n$.

    Let the LHS be $f(x)$. The graph of $f$ looks like a bunch of lines, and $f$ is continuous (why?). 
    The maximum absolute value of the slope of a line that's part of $f$ can be is $42$, which means that if $f$ crosses 
    the RHS then $f(1) \geq 0$, since $x = 1$ is where the minimum of $42|x-1|$ is attained; 
    if $f(1) < 0$ then $f$ will never cross $42|x-1|$. This is because for $f$ to cross $42|x-1|$ for $x < 1$ when $f(1) < 0$, 
    $f$ would have to somehow go from being above the V-shaped absolute value graph of $42|x-1|$ to below it at $x = 1$, impossible 
    since no part of $f$ has slope of absolute value greater than $42$; analogously we see that $f$ cannot cross $42|x-1|$ when $x > 1$. Solve to get 
    $-\frac{441}{10} \leq a \leq -\frac{21}{10}$ and $0 \leq a \leq 42$. Our probability is $\frac{21}{25} \iff \boxed{2125}.$
