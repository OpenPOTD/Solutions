\SSpsetQ{

	Chris draws a line segment between each of the points
	$$A(4, 4), B(-4, 4), C(-4, -4), D(4, -4), E(2, 0), F(0, 2), G(-2, 0), H(0, -2)$$
	on a sheet of paper large enough so that none of the line segments touch the edge of the paper. 
	He wants to separate all the regions obtained by the line segments and later on eat them. \medskip

	What is the maximum number of regions of paper that Chris can eat?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
	Note that the diagram is diagonally symmetric, so we need only to look at the intersections 
	in the interior of $\triangle AOB$, where $O$ is the origin. Count that there are 15 intersections, 
	then multiply by 4 to get 60. However, the troll is that Chris is cutting out sections on a piece of paper, 
	so the outside of square $ABCD$ is also a region and our answer is \fbox{61}.
