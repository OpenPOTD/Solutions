\SSpsetQ{
  Points $B'$ and $C'$ are chosen on side $\overline{BC}$ of $\triangle ABC$ such that 
  $BB' = 1$, $B'C' = 24$, and $CC' = 3$. Given that the circle with diameter $\overline{B'C'}$ 
  is tangent to $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $p$. 
  Find $\lfloor 100p \rfloor$.
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
  Let the circle touch $\overline{AB}$ at $P$ and $\overline{AC}$ at $Q$. Then, by Power of Point 
  we have $BP^2 = BB' \cdot BC' \iff BP = 5$ and similarly $CQ = 9$. Then let $AP = d = AQ$ and the 
  midpoint of $\overline{B'C'}$ be $M$; by angle bisector theorem we have 
  $$\dfrac{5 + d}{9 + d} = \dfrac{13}{15} \iff d = 21$$
  so our perimeter is \fbox{84}.
\end{solution}\bigskip
