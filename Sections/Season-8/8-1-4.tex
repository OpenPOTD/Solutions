\SSpsetQ{
	Find the remainder when \(122^{2020} - 102^{2020} - 21^{2020}\) is divided by 2020. 
	%Put Problem Here
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
	Let \(X = 122^{2020} - 102^{2020} - 21^{2020}\). \\
	Note that \(2020 = 20 \times 101\). In particular, considering the expression mod 20 we get \(X = 2^{2020} - 2^{2020} - 1^{2020} \equiv -1 \pmod{20}\), and considering it mod 101 we get \(X = 21^{2020} - 1^{2020} - 21^{2020} \equiv -1 \pmod{101}\). \\
	In particular, by Chinese Remainder Theorem we get \(X \equiv -1 \pmod{2020}\) which means that the remainder on division by 2020 of \(X\) is \(\boxed{2019}\). \\
	\emph{Note: The choice of 2020 in the exponent is not special.}
