\SSpsetQ{
Zella and Samantha stand at either end of a straight track. They then run at a constant (not different) speets to the other end of the track, turn and run back to their origional end at the same seed they ran before. On their first leg, they pass each other 20m from one end of the track. When they are both on their return leg, they pass each other for a second time 10m from the other end of the track. How many meters long is the track?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

Let the distance of the track be \(d\), and the speeds of the two runners be \(u\) and \(v\) respectively. And let \(t_i\) be the time for which the runners are at a particular position. Then on the first leg we must have \(20 = ut_1\) and \(d - 20 = vt_1\), While on the second leg, \(d + 10 = ut_2\) and \(2d - 10 = vt_2\). Therefore we have 
\begin{align}
    \frac{ut_1}{vt_2} = \frac{ut_2}{vt_2}\Rightarrow \frac{20}{d - 20} &= \frac{d + 10}{2d - 10}\\
    d(d - 50) &= 0
\end{align}
Thus we must have \(d = \fbox{50}\)
\end{solution}\bigskip
