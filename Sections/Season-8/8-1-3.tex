\SSpsetQ{
Define a function \(f:\{1,2,\ldots,12\}\to\{1,2,\ldots,6\}\) such that for every \(y\in \{1,2,\ldots,6\}\) there exists exactly two elements \(x_1,x_2\in \{1,2,\ldots,12\}\) such that \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)=y\). How many such functions are there which map \(\{1,2,\ldots,12\}\) to \(\{1,2,\ldots,6\}\) with the described property?

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

This well known property can be derived simply by considering how we can choose two elements in \(\{1,2,\ldots,12\}\) and enumerating that. Let the number of such functions be \(F\), then we have:
\begin{align*}
  F&=\prod_{i=1}^{12}\binom{2i}{2}\\
  &=\frac{12!}{2^6}\\
  &=\fbox{7484400}\ \mathrm{such\ functions}
\end{align*}
