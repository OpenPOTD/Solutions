\SSpsetQ{
   Let \(a_1=19,\ a_2=98\). For \(n\geq 1\), define \(a_{n+2}\) to be the remainder of \(a_n+a_{n+1}\) when it is divided by 100. What is the remainder when \[a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a^2_{1998}\]is divided by 8?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

   Consider the remainders of $a_i$ mod 4: the first six are $3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3$ and it repeats every six. Since $6|1998$ it sufices to find the remainder
   when $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_6^2$ is divided by 8; since odd squares are 1 mod 8, $2^2$ is 4, and $0^2$ is 0 we have $4 \cdot 1^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 \equiv \boxed{0}\pmod{8}.$
