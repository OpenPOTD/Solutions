\SSpsetQ{
  $482$ students are seated in their own $1 \text{ foot}\times 1\text{ foot}$ squares in a $21 \text{ feet} \times 23 \text{ feet}$ room, and the square at the center of the room is left open for a air purifier. The teacher is left with the arduous task of moving every student into a different adjacent square to move the air purifier to a different spot in the room. This means every student must move forwards, backwards, or to the left and right by one square, and no $2$ students can share the same square. If each student moves randomly, the probability that the square with no one in it is the one in the top left hand corner can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms. Find $mn$

\begin{solution}[Write up by \Ppi]\footnote{This question has been voided due to the problem statement being confusing - the intended answer was 0, as there were no such ways, however this was confusing as the result involves dividing by 0}\hfil\medskip
 
  We color the squares like a chessboard. So then there are $242$ "black" squares, and $240$ "white" squares (because the air purifier is covering the one in the middle). But since $242 \neq 240$ it is impossible for this to work. So $mn$ is simply $\boxed{0}$.
\end{solution}\bigskip
