\SSpsetQ{
    Consider the sequence \(5,\ 55,\ 555,\ 5555,\ldots\)\medskip

    How many digits does the smallest number in the sequence have which is divisible by 495?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    We require the term to be divisible by \(5\cdot9\cdot 11\).
    Hence we need only consider the sequence \(1,\ 11,\ 111\,\ldots\) with respect to \(9\cdot11\).
    Clearly for odd numbered terms in the sequence, 11 does not divide into it, by the well-known divisibility rule for 11.
    Therefore, we require an even numbered term in the sequence, which is divisible by 9.
    We know 9 divides a number iff its digital sum is also divisible by 9.
    Hence, the smallest such will be the 18th term in the sequence, which will naturally have \fbox{18} digits. 
\end{solution}\bigskip

\begin{solution}[Write up by \Paiya]\hfil\medskip
     
    Each of these numbers can be written as \(5\cdot1\ldots1,\)whee there are \(n\) total ones.
    This can be rewritten as \(5\cdot(10^{n-1}+10^{n-2}+\cdots+10^0)=\frac{5}{9}(10^n-1)\).
    Note that \(495=9\cdot11\cdot5\) so we want \(9|\frac{10^n-1}{9}\) and \(10^n\equiv1\mod{11}\).
    From the congruence \(\mod{11}\) we see that \(n\) must be even.
    Note that \(10^n-1=9\ldots9\), where there are \(n\) total nines; if \(n\) is a multiple of 9 then \(\frac{10^n-1}{9}=1\ldots1\) where there are \(n\) total ones; this is a multiple of 9.
    Since \(n\) must be even, the smallest such \(n\) is \fbox{18}.
\end{solution}
