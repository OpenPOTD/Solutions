\SSpsetQ{
  $p, q$ are positive integers such that $pq = 2021^{2021}.$ What is the minimal number of digits in $p + q?$
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
By AM-GM the minimal value of $p + q$ occurs when $p, q$ are close; an obvious close pair is $(p, q) = \left(43^{1010}, 47^{1010}\right)$
and the minimal possible value of $p + q$ (over positive reals) occurs at $p = q = 2021^{1010.5}$. The number of digits in a number $n$
is $\left\lfloor \log_{10}(n) \right\rfloor + 1$; noticing this we see that both our obvious guess and the absolute minimum have \fbox{3341} digits.
\end{solution}\bigskip
