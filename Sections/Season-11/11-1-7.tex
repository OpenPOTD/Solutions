\SSpsetQ{
    For a point $P$ on the surface of a regular tetrahedron with side length $1$, define the \textit{isolation} of $P$ to be the smallest $d$ such that 
    an ant crawling on the surface of the tetrahedron, starting at $P$, can reach any other point on the tetrahedron by traveling at most $d$ units.
    Find the total length of the locus of points whose isolation is $\frac{21}{20}$.
