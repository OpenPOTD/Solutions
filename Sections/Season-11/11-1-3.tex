\SSpsetQ{
    Rain is falling at an angle of 2.021 (radians) measured anticlockwise from the positive $x$-axis, with velocity 2021. A unit sphere rolls from the origin to $(2021, 0)$
    with constant speed $v$. \medskip
    
    Given that $v$ minimizes the amount of rain that falls on the ball, find $\lfloor 10^2v \rfloor$, where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal tos $x$. \medskip
    
    \begin{center}
    	\emph{Note that if you run too fast, you end up running \emph{into} the rain.}
    \end{center}
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    Change the frame of reference such that the rain is still relative to you; this can be done by moving the entire plane with velocity $(2021 \cos \theta, 2021 \sin \theta)$
    where $\theta = 2.021$, the angle at which rain falls. This means that your destination point will be on the line with slope $\tan \theta$ passing through $(2021, 0$
    and your new velocity vector is $(v + 2021 \cos \theta, 2021 \sin \theta)$. To minimize the amount of rain that falls on you, you should run through as little rain
    as possible, which means your path should be perpendicular to the destination line; this is achieved when your velocity vector has direction $\tan \left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}\right).$
    Solving, we get $$\tan \left(\theta - \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right) = \dfrac{2021 \sin \theta}{v + 2021 \cos \theta} \iff v = 4644.3870 \iff \boxed{464438}.$$
\end{solution}\bigskip
