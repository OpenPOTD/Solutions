\SSpsetQ{
    A circle with area $\frac{20}{21}$ is placed randomly in the plane. What is the probability that the circle will contain a lattice point? (Formally,
    if $p_M$ is the probability that a circle with center chosen randomly in $[-M, M]^2$ contains a lattice point, find $\lim_{M \to \infty} p_M$.)
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    By symmetry, it suffices to consider the probability when the circle's center is chosen randomly inside a unit square. Draw four quartercircular arcs,
    one at each vertex; such a circle's center must be contained in the union of those arcs in order for it to contain a lattice point (otherwise a lattice point
    would more more than $r$ away from the circle's center). Shown below is the diagram.

    Since the arcs overlap, we split the area into four isosceles triangles and four arcs. The base angle of the triangle is $\arccos\left(\frac{1}{2r}\right)$
    and the height of the triangle is $\sqrt{r^2 - \frac{1}{4}}$ so the angle of the arc is $\frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \arccos\left(\frac{1}{2r}\right).$ Multiplying by
    four and plugging in $r = \sqrt{\frac{20}{21\pi}}$ we get
    $$P = \boxed{2 \sqrt{\dfrac{20}{21\pi} - \dfrac{1}{4}} + \dfrac{20}{21}\left(1 - \dfrac{4 \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{21 \pi}}{2\sqrt{20}}\right)}{\pi}\right)}.$$
