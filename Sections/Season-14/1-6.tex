\SSpsetQ{
    There are 2021 crewmates in the universe, and some of these crewmates are members of different crews (crewmates can belong to multiple crews at once). 
    Each crew has a security council consisting of 12 crewmates who are members of that particular crew. 
    An \textit{emergency meeting} (for a particular crew) can be realized only when each participant (of the meeting) is a member of that crew, and moreover, 
    each of the 12 crewmates forming the security council (for that crew) are present among the participants. 
    It is known that each subset of at least 12 crewmates can realize an emergency meeting for exactly one crew. 
    If the total number of different crews with exactly 29 crewmates is $N$, find $\nu_2(N) + \nu_3(N) + \nu_5(N).$
