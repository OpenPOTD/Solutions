\SSpsetQ{Let $a_0 = -2$, $b_0 = 1$, and for $n \geq 0$, let 
\[
a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n + \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2}
\]
\[
b_{n+1} = a_n + b_n - \sqrt{a_n^2+b_n^2}
\]

If $a_{2020}$ can be represented in the form $a^x\sqrt{b}- c^y$, where $a,b,c$ are integers such that $a,c$ are minimized and $c$ is square free. Find $x+y$.
}

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
By adding the two equations and multiplying them respectively, we get 
\[
a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = 2(a_n+b_n)
\]
\[
a_{n+1}b_{n+1} = (a_n+b_n)^2 - (a_n^2 + b_n^2) = 2 a_nb_n
\]
Thus, we get that 
\[
a_{2020} + b_{2020} = -2^{2020}
\]
\[
a_{2020}b_{2020} = -2^{2021}
\]
Either by vieta's or substitution, we get $a_{2020}, b_{2020}$ are the roots of  the quadratic
\[
x^2 +2^{2020}x - 2^{2021}
\]
where $a_{2020}$ is the larger root since the positive sqrt was added. Solving the quadratic gives that 
\[
a_{2020} = 2^{1010}\sqrt{2^{2018} + 2} - 2^{2019}
\]
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{3029}$
\end{solution}
