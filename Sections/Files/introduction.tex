Welcome to the OpenPOTD solutions booklet! Here you'll find answers \& solutions to all past seasons.\medskip

Solutions for season one were entirely written up by Brainysmurfs\#2860, while I (.19\#9839) have overseen most of season two. 
Where possible, from season two onwards, I have tried to include the officially provided solutions to problems, 
or adapted them in line with any changes to the problem statement, and in most cases also and filled 
in the gaps as best I could, to make solutions more approachable to beginners. 
In many circumstances problems have not come with official write-ups and thus have required me to provide my own -
 in which case I apologise for any mistakes (or fakesolves!) in advance.\medskip

If any mistakes are found, feel free to DM me \(.19\#9839\) or submit a push to the Github.
Similarly, if you would like to contribute an alternate solution, or improve an existing one in this document,
 again, feel free to submit a push or just DM me a solution and I can type it up. 
This applies to both recent problems and seasons, as well as older ones (no matter how old!).\bigskip
