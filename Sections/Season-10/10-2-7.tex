\SSpsetQ{
    Suppose \(n\) lamps are arranged in a circle, numbered from 1 to \(n\) clockwise, with \(0\geq L \geq n\) lamps turned on. A testing procedure consists of performing the following operations: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for each lamp turned on, we take its number \(i\); the \(i\) lamps following it clockwise receive a signal
        \item After a signal has been sent for each lamp turned on, every lamp which received an odd number of signals will have its state changed; those receiving an even number of signals will not.
    \end{itemize}
       Let \(T\) be the set of all \(2^n\) possible initial configurations. We define a function \(t\) from \(T\) to \(T\), where if \(X\) represents an initial configuration of lamps, \(t(X)\) is the configuration obtained after applying the testing procedure to \(X\). Suppose \(S\) is the sum of all integers \(n < 2^{2015}\) such that the function \(t\) is bijective. Find the smallest positive integer \(c\) such that \(2^c\) is greater than the sum of every element of \(S\).
