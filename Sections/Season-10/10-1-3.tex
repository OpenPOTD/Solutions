\SSpsetQ{
   What is the largest prime number which divides

   \[0!+1!\times1+2!\times2+3!\times3+\cdots+159!\times 159 + 160!\times 160\]
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

We proceed by using the identity \(n!+n!\times n = (n+1)!\) and iterating:
\begin{align}
    &0!+1!\times 1+\cdots\\
    &2!+2!\times2+\cdots\\
    &3!+3!\times3+\cdots\\
    &\cdots\\
    &161!
\end{align}
As neither 161 nor 159 are prime, the largest prime divisor of the sum is \fbox{157}
\end{solution}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    Note that $(n + 1)! - 1$ counts the non-identity permutations of $(1, 2, \cdots , n + 1)$. 
    Consider a permutation where $(1, 2, \cdots n - k)$ are fixed points but $n - k + 1$ is not a fixed point.
    So $n - k + 1$ can go in the $n - k + 2^{\text{nd}}$ to $n + 1^{\text{st}}$ spots, which is a total of $k$ possibilites;
    the remainder of the $k$ terms can be permuted willy-nilly. Thus, there $k \cdot k!$ such possibilities, and summing over 
    $k$ from $1$ to $n$ (since $k = n + 1$ gives the identity permutation) yields the identity. \fbox{157}
