\SSpsetQ{
    MODSbot has trapped Brainy at the southwest entrance of a two-by-fifteen grid of cells. To escape, Brainy has to enter into the grid from the southwest cell
    and exit through the northeast cell. However, MODSbot can fill any subset of the 20 cells with cement, effectively blocking off those cells.
    Out of all $2^{30}$ possible grid configuations, in how many of them can Brainy escape?

    Follow the \href{https://hmmt-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/tournaments/2018/nov/guts/solutions.pdf}{official solution} to get the recursion for $a_n$ and $b_n$.
    Iterating 15 indices of $a$ and $b$ is inefficient; for efficient computation we let $c_n = a_n + b_n$ and note that $c_{n + 1} = 2c_n + c_{n - 1}$; either directly recursing or finding a closed form yields 
    $c_{15} = 665857$. By inspection, we have $a_n = b_n - 1$ so $a_n = \boxed{332928}$.
