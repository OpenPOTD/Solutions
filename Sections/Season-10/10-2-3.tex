\SSpsetQ{
	In the following diagram every circle has two internally tangent circles also tangent to each other. The radius of the biggest circle is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}$. If the area of the black region can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, compute $100a+b$.

\begin{solution}[Solution by \Phobo]\hfil\medskip
	
	Let $r_n$ and $A_n$ be the radius and the area of the nth circle (in descending order). From construction we have $r_{n+1}=\frac{r_{n}}{2}$ which leads to $r_n=\frac{r_0}{2^n}$, where $r_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}$. Looking at the desired area $A_{\zeta}$ as difference of black and white circles areas, we get the following:
	\begin{align}
		A_{\zeta}&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-2)^n A_{n} \\
		&=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-2)^n (r_n)^2 \pi \\
		&=(r_0)^2 \pi \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \\
		&=\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right)^2\pi\frac{1}{1-\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)} \\ 
		&= \frac{2}{3}
	\end{align}
	Which means $\boxed{203}$ is the solution.

\begin{solution}[Solution by \Pflame]\hfil\medskip

	Let $B$ be the total black area; the total white area is then $1 - B$. Looking at the two biggest white circles, we see that each of them is similar
	to the big circle by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ with colors inverted; thus the total black area inside each of the two white circles is $\frac{1 - B}{4}$.
	Since the black area outside the two big white circles is $\frac{1}{2}$ we have $$B = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1 - B}{2} \iff B = \dfrac{2}{3} \iff \boxed{203}.$$
