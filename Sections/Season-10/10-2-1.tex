\SSpsetQ{
	Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of integers $n$ such that $$\sqrt{\frac{(2021-k)^2}{2021-k^2}}$$ is a real number. \medskip
	
	Compute the sum of all elements in $\mathcal{S}$. 
	%Put Problem Here
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
	The numerator is always real, so we seek $k$ such that $2021 - k^2 > 0$; however if $k$ satisfies this inequality so does $-k$. Then observe
	$k = 2021$ makes the numerator 0, so it is real too. $\boxed{2021}$.
