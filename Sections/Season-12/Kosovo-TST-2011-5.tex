\SSpsetQ{
	There exist functions $f: \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1, -1\} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the following holds:
    $$f\left(\dfrac{x - 3}{1 + x}\right) + f\left(\dfrac{x + 3}{1 - x}\right) = x$$
    Then the average value of $$\sum_{k = 2}^{100} \dfrac{f(k)}{k}$$ can be 
    expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are relatively prime integers and $n$ is positive. Find $100m + n$. \medskip

    (For example, if the solutions to that FE were $f(x) \equiv 0$ and $f(x) \equiv -x^2$ then the average value of that sum would be $-\frac{5049}{2}$
    and your answer would be $2 - 504900 = -504898$.)\medskip

    The unique function can be found using \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h403803}{AoPS solutions}; then note that $\frac{f(x)}{x}$ can be decomposed into partial fractions and so the sum telescopes.
