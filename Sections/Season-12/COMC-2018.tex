\SSpsetQ{
	Five \emph{distinct} integers $e, n, j, o, y$ are such that \[e\cdot n \cdot j \cdot o \cdot y = 775.\]
	Find \( e + n + j + o + y\). 
	%Put Problem Here
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
	Note that \(775 = 5^2 \cdot 31\). In particular, this means that the only way to factor into 5 distinct integers is to have \( \{e, n, j, o, y\} = \{1, -1, 5, -5, 31\} \), giving us a sum of \(1 - 1 + 5 - 5 + 31 = \boxed{31}\).
