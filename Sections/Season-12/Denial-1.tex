\SSpsetQ{
	A circle of radius 1 is centred at \((1,1)\). Points \(A\) and \(B\) have co-ordinates \((a, 0)\) and \((0, b)\), with \(a,b > 2\). If \(AB\) is tangent to the circle, what is the sum of all possible integer values of \(a\) and \(b\)?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}[Solution by \Pdenial]\hfil\medskip
	
	Let \(O, C, D\) and \(E\) have coordinates \((1,1), (0,0), (0,1)\) and \((1,0)\) respectively, and let the point of tangency of \(AB\) with the circle be \(F\).\\
Note since \(O\) and \(D\) have the same \(y\) co-ordinate \(OD\) is parallel to the \(x\)-axis and hence perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis. Since \(D\) is also on the \(y\)-axis, \(BC\) is tangent to the circle at \(D\). Similarly, \(O\) and \(E\) have the same \(x\) co-ordinate, so \(OE\) is parallel to the \(y\)-axis and hence perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis. Since \(E\) is also on the \(x\)-axis, \(AC\) is tangent to the circle at \(E\).\\
Since the tangents to a circle from a point have equal length, \(BF = BD\) and \(FA = AE\). Summing, \(BF + FA = BD + AE\), so \(BA = (BC - CD) + (AC - CE) = (b-1) + (a-1) = a + b - 2\), giving \(AB^2 = (a+b-2)^2\). However, since \(\angle ACB = 90^{\circ}\), by Pythagoras' theorem, \(AB^2 = a^2 + b^2\), and so we have
\begin{equation*}a^2 + b^2 = (a+b-2)^2\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 4 + 2ab - 4a - 4b\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}0 = 2ab - 4a - 4b + 4\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}ab - 2a - 2b + 2 = 0\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}ab - 2a - 2b + 4 = 2\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}(a-2)(b-2) = 2\end{equation*}
However, \(a,b > 2\), so if \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, then \(a-2\) and \(b-2\) are positive integers and hence must both be positive factors of \(2\). Since 2 is primes, its only factorisation is as \(2 = 2 \times 1\), so either \(a-2 = 2\) and \(b-2 = 1\) or \(a-2 = 1\) and \(b-2 = 2\). Hence the possible integer values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \((a,b) = (3,4)\) or \((4,3)\). Giving a final answer of \fbox{14}
\end{solution}\bigskip
