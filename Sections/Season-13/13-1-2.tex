\SSpsetQ{
    Given that for \(f(x)=x^2+bx+7\) and \(f(x)\ne -18\), the possible values of \(b\) can be written in the form \(x<b<y\). What is the value of \(x^2+y^2\)?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    We want to find the values of be such that \(x^2+bx+7=-18\) has no real solutions. By taking the discriminant, we see that we require \(b^2-4\cdot25<0\iff -10<b<10\). Therefore our answer is \fbox{200}.

\end{solution}\bigskip
