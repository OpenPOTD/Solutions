\SSpsetQ{
    Points $A, B, C, D$ are located at $(-3, 0), (1, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0)$ in the coordinate plane. If the locus of points $P$ such that 
    the circumcircles of $\triangle ABP$ and $\triangle CDP$ are tangent has perimeter $p$, find $\lfloor 100p \rfloor$.

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
    Let $X$ have coordinates $(x, y)$, and $Y$ be the intersection of the radical axis of the two circumcircles and segment $\overline{BC}$.
    Let $BY = b$; then $CY = 5 - b$. By Power of a Point, we have $$XY^2 = BY \cdot AY = CY \cdot DY = b(4 + b) = (5 - b)(6 - b) \iff b = 2, XY^2 = 12$$
    so $X$ is always a distance of $\sqrt{12}$ from the point $Y = (3, 0)$; this is a circle with radius $\sqrt{12}$ and so our answer is \fbox{2176}.
