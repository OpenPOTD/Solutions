Answer: \fbox{25}

It is not too difficult to find the answer through educated guessing and checking, but below is a solution that does not require guessing.

Let $x$ be the tens digit of $n$ and let $y$ be the ones digit of $n$.

Then the problem can be translated into:
$2(10x+y)+2=10y+x$

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$19x=8y-2$

We can easily deduce that:
$19x=8y-2=38$

Therefore:
$x=2 and y=5$

Finally:
$n=10x+y=25$
