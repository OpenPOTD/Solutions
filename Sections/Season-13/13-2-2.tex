\SSpsetQ{
	Let $\ell$ be a line and let points $A$, $B$, $C$ lie on $\ell$ so that $AB = 7$ and $BC = 5$. Let $m$ be the line through $A$ perpendicular to $\ell$. Let $P$ lie on $m$. Compute the smallest possible value of $PB + PC$.

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
	Clearly, the minimum occurs when $A = P$. If $C$ is between $A$ and $B$ then the distance $PB + PC$ is lower than if $C$ is not between $A$ and $B$, giving us an answer of \fbox{9}.
