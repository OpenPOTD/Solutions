\SSpsetQ{
	Three different positive integers have the property that each of them divides the sum of the other two. Let S be a possible set of three such integers. What is the smallest possible integer in S such that the sum of the three integers in S is greater than 2021?

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
	
	Let the three integers be \(a, b, c\) where \(0 < a < b < c\). This means that \(a + b < 2c\) and because \(c | a + b\) $\rightarrow$ \(a + b = c\). We also know that \(b|a + c \) $\rightarrow$ \(b|2a + b\) $\rightarrow$ \(b|2a\). \(b > a\) meaning that \(b = 2a\) and this gives us the solutions \((a, 2a, 3a)\). This gives that the sum of the integers in S is \(6a\) and the smallest multiple of 6 greater than 2021 is 2022. This gives that \(a\) is \(\frac{2022}{6} = \boxed{337}\) which is the answer.
