\SSpsetQ{
    Choi has three types of counters, coloured red, blue and green which she must place on a numberline consisting of the numbers 1,2 and 3.
    
    In how many ways can she arrange the counters such that no red counter is directly to the left of a blue counter?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    There are \(3^3\) ways of arranging the counters without restrictions and \(2\cdot3=6\) ways to pick the red counter being next to the blue counter, thus we have \(3^3-6=\fbox{21}\) total ways.

\end{solution}\bigskip
