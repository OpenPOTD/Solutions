\SSpsetQ{
    Given that \( z = 3+i \) is a root of \( z^2+pz+q=0 \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are real, 
    find the values of \(p\) and \(q\), and submit \( p+q \).
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
    
    Applying the Complex Conjugate Theorem, $z=3-i$ is also a root of the quadratic. 
    Expanding $(z-3-i)(z-3+i)$ gives us $z^2-6z+10$. Thus $p = -6$ and $q = 10$, meaning $p + q = \boxed{4}$.
\end{solution}\bigskip
