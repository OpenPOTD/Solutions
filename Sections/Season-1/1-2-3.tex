\SSpsetQ{
    If the polynomial \( x^2 + bx + 101 = 0 \) has integer roots \( m \) and \( n \), where 
    \( \vert m \vert > \vert n \vert \), then what is the sum of the positive integer divisors of \( \frac mn \)?
}\bigskip 

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip 

    By Vieta's Formula $101 = mn$. Since $101$ is prime, $m, n = \pm 101, \pm 1$. So $\frac mn = \pm 101$. 
    The positive divisors of $\pm 101$ are 1 and 101, so their sum is $1 + 101 = \boxed{102}$.
\end{solution}\bigskip
