\SSpsetQ{
    The ingredients list of a Guava Juice Drink is as follows:
        \begin{quote}
            Water (80\%), Guava Juice, Sugar, Fructose (3\%), Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Citric Acid, Flavour, Vitamin C (0.04\%)
        \end{quote}
    Assuming only that the ingredients list is ordered by their constituent percentage in the drink (which are not necessarily distinct), 
    find the maximum and minimum possible percentage of Guava Juice in the drink. If their difference is \(n\), submit \(100n\).
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    Note there are 2 ingredients between water and fructose, and 3 between fructose and Vitamin C. \\

    For the amount of guava juice to be maximised, everything should be minimised. 
    In particular, there should be 0.04\% of Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Citric Acid, and Flavour; and 3\% of Sugar and Fructose. 
    This gives us a Guava Juice percentage of 13.84\%. \\

    For the amount of guava juice to be minimised, everything else should be maximised. 
    In particular, there should be 3\% of Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Citric Acid, and Flavour;
     and equal amounts of sugar and guava juice. 
    This gives us a guava juice percentage of 5.48\%. \\

    This gives us $13.84 - 3.98 = 9.86 \%$. 
    Multiplying this by $100$ gives us $\boxed{986}$. 
\end{solution}\bigskip
