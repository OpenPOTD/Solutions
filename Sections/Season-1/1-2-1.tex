\SSpsetQ{
    Out of 100 regenerative watermelons, each of six friends eats exactly 75 watermelons. 
    There are \( n \) watermelons eaten by at least five of the friends. 
    What is the sum of the largest and smallest possible values of \( n \)?\\

    \textit{Note: The watermelons are regenerative to allow multiple people to eat the same watermelon. 
    (But the same person cannot eat the same watermelon more than once)}
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    Maximum: The maximum is 90. Take the sum over all watermelons of how many times they were eaten. 
    This is 450, since all $6 \cdot 75 = 450$. Then since $5n \leq 450$, $n \leq 90$. T
    he construction for the maximum is: staff member $k$ ($k = 1, 2, \cdots, 6$) eats all watermelons from 1 to 90 except those $k \pmod6$. \\

    Minimum: The minimum is 25. We intuit that in the minimum case all the watermelons were either eaten 6 times or 4. 
    Then $6a + 4b = 450$, and $a + b = 75$. Solving yields $a = 25$ and $b = 75$. \\

    The answer is $25 + 90 = \boxed{115}$. 
\end{solution}\bigskip
