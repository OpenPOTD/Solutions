\SSpsetQ{
    Two cubes with positive integer side lengths are such that the sum of their volumes is numerically equal to the difference of their surface areas. Find the sum of their volumes.
}\bigskip 

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip 

    A direct search yields that cubes of side length $4$ and $2$ satisfy the condition. The answer is thus $4^3 + 2^3 = \boxed{72}$.
