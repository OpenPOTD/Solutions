\SSpsetQ{
    Let triangle \(ABC\) have incentre \(I\) and circumcenter \(O\). 
    Suppose that \( \angle AIO = 90^{\circ} \) and \( \angle CIO = 45^{\circ} \). 
    Suppose the ratio \( AB : BC : CA \) can be expressed as \( a : b : c \) where \( \gcd(a, b, c) = 1 \). 
    Find \( a + b + c \).
}\bigskip 

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    Place a $3-4-5$ triangle on the coordinate plane with $A = (0, 0)$, $B = (3, 0)$ and $C = (0, 4)$. 
    We can compute that $I = (1, 1)$ and $O = (1.5, 2)$. 
    This arrangement of points satisfies the question's constraints, and so the answer is $3 + 4 + 5 = \boxed{12}$.
