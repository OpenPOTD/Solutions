\SSpsetQ{
    If \( a \) and \( b \) are positive reals such that \( a^b = b^a \) and \( b = 2a \), 
    then the value of \( b^2 \) is? 
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip

    A direct search yields that $2^4 = 4^2$ and $4 = 2 \times 2$. 
    The problem implies that such a unique value for $b$ exists, hence $b^2 = \boxed{16}$.
\end{solution}\bigskip
