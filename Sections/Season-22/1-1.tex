\SSpsetQ{

How many ways are there to arrange 20 white balls and 22 black balls in a line such that 
no two black balls are next to each other?
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    \fbox{0} ways. Place balls from left to right: every time we place a black ball, a white 
    must follow right after. But there are only 20 whites, so there must exist a black-black 
    ball pair. 
\end{solution}\bigskip
