\SSpsetQ{

Find the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^6 \leq 42^9.$
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    We find $n = \pm 42\sqrt{42}$. To approximate $\sqrt{42}$, we could brute-force, using 
    $65^2 = 4225$ and working our way down from $n = 274$ to find $n = 272$ as the largest 
    integer solution. Since $n^6 = (-n)^6$, our answer is $\boxed{-272}.$ \medskip

    However, a better way to approximate is to use the binomial theorem: 
    $$42^{1/2} = (36 + 6)^{1/2} = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \dbinom{1/2}{k} 36^{1/2 - k}6^k = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \dbinom{1/2}{k}6^{1 - k}.$$ 
    Just the first three terms gives us $\sqrt{42} \approx 6 + 1/2 - 1/48 = 6 + 23/48$, so 
    $$42\sqrt{42} \approx 42 \cdot 6 + \dfrac{23 \cdot 7}{8} = 252 + \dfrac{23 \cdot 8 - 23}{8} = 272 + \dfrac{1}{8}.$$
\end{solution}\bigskip
