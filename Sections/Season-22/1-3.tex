\SSpsetQ{
  Lizzie writes a list of fractions as follows. First, she writes $\frac{1}{1}$, 
  the only fraction whose
numerator and denominator add to 2. Then she writes the two fractions whose numerator
and denominator add to 3, in increasing order of denominator. Then she writes the three
fractions whose numerator and denominator sum to 4 in increasing order of denominator. She
continues in this way until she has written all the fractions whose numerator and denominator
sum to at most 1000. So Lizzie's list looks like:
$$\dfrac{1}{1}, \dfrac{2}{1}, \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{3}{1}, \dfrac{2}{2}, \dfrac{1}{3}, \cdots, \dfrac{1}{999}.$$
Let $p_k$ be the product of the first $k$ fractions in Lizzie's list. Find, with proof, the value of
$p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{499500}$.

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
 
  \href{https://usamts.org/Solutions/Solutions_30_3.pdf}{Solution.} In general, if this list 
  of fractions continues indefinitely, and the sum goes to $T_n$ instead of $499500$, the 
  answer is $\boxed{2^{n + 1} - (n + 2)}$.
