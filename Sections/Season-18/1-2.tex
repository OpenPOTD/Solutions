\SSpsetQ{

There are three eight-digit positive integers, two of which are 24678051 and 88593477, 
such that each are equal to the sum of the eighth powers of their digits. Find the third. 
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    It's \fbox{24678050}, since that's one less than 24678051 and $0^8$ is one less than $1^8.$
\end{solution}\bigskip
