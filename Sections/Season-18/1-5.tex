\SSpsetQ{

Two congruent 2021-gons are placed such that a pair of their edges touch each other. A pencil 
is attached to one of the vertices, and that 2021-gon is rotated around the other. Each time 
their two edges perfectly meet again, the pencil dots the page, and a line is drawn connecting 
the two most recent dots. Find the area of this shape the pencil traces out.
