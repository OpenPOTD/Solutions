\SSpsetQ{
  In the MODS Lottery, $50$ balls are drawn at random from $n > 100$ balls numbered $1$ through $n$. If the probability that no pair of consecutive numbers is drawn is equal to the probability that exactly $1$ pair is drawn, find $n$. 
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}[Write up by \Ppi]\hfil\medskip
 
  Since the probabilities are equal, we have that the number of ways each is possible to be equal.

  We first count the number of drawings that no pair of consecutive numbers are drawn. We can add $0$ and $n+1$ to the list for ease. So we have some $a_0+a_1+\cdots+a_{50} = n-50$ where the plus signs represent the numbers drawn. But since all $a_1$ to $a_{49}$ need to be positive, we subtract $49$ from $n-50$. So we are left with $a_0+a_1'+\cdots+a_{49}'+a_{50} = n-49-50$. There are $\binom{n-49}{50}$ ways to do this. 
  
  For the second case, there are $n-49$ "slots" that we can put our numbers in. We can choose one of these "slots" and put $2$ of our $50$ balls in them. Then we have $n-50$ "slots" remaining for our $48$ balls. So we have $(n-49) \cdot \binom{n-50}{48}$.
  
  Then setting the two equal we have 
  $$\frac{(n-49)!}{50!(n-99)!} = \frac{(n-49)!}{48!(n-98)!}$$
  $$50\cdot49 = n-98$$
  $$n = \boxed{2548}$$

\end{solution}\bigskip
