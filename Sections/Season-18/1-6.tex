\SSpsetQ{

Find all ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers such that $a + b + c = 2020$ and there exist nonzero reals $x, y, z$ such that $$x^2 + y^2 = axy, y^2 + z^2 + byz, z^2 + x^2 = czx.$$
}\bigskip

\begin{solution}\hfil\medskip
  
    If $a + b + c = N$, the valid $(a, b, c)$ are such that $abc = (N + 2)^2$. I can't find my scratch work, so this'll have to suffice for now. Answer: \fbox{} \medskip

    Alternatively you can use some obscure trig identity from \textit{Problems from the Book}.
